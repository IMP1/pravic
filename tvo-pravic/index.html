                    About tvo-Pravic
                </h1>
                <p>
                    First, a disclaimer: the version of Pravic described on this website is not a definitive version. Ursula Le Guin has not given her approval or support for this version. She has, however, been approached via her literary agent, and she has not indicated her disapproval of the project, either. In a truly anarchistic approach, she seems to be letting each individual decide for themself.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The version of Pravic used in the Night School on Anarres project (hereafter this version of Pravic, tvo-Pravic, or, with apologies to other designers, Pravic) has started from the design principles set out in <em>The Dispossessed</em>. Where possible the phonology, word structure and ethos of the language have been followed. Some compromises have had to be made, but they are nearly all phonological, and do not affect the logical principles Le Guin has followed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Having said that, tvo-Pravic has some unusual linguistic features. The main way it differs from other human languages is that it reduces emphasis on the actor of an action by emphasising the outcome. So, for instance, the sentence <span class="translation-example" lang="en">Mary did it</span> is passivized into <span class="translation-example" lang="pravlish">It was-done-by Mary</span>. Most tvo-Pravic verbs have passive meanings (e.g. <span class="translation-example" lang="en">see</span> becomes <span class="translation-example" lang="pravlish">be-seen-by</span>, <span class="translation-example" lang="en">do</span> becomes <span class="translation-example" lang="pravlish">be-done-by</span>). Some owning verbs cannot be directly translated into tvo-Pravic: for example,
                    <span class="translation-example" lang="en">I have a son</span> changes to <span class="translation-example" lang="pravlish">a-child is a-responsibility of-the-speaker; the-child is a-male.</span>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another way that tvo-Pravic differs is in the use of pronouns. In theory, pronouns do not exist, they are replaced by nominal forms. So <span class="translation-example" lang="en">I</span> is represented as <span class="translation-example" lang="pravlish">a-speaker</span>, and <span class="translation-example" lang="en">you</span> as <span class="translation-example" lang="pravlish">the-listener</span>. Possessive pronouns are not used; the nearest equivalent to <span class="translation-example" lang="en">my coat</span> is <span class="translation-example" lang="pravlish">the-coat is a-responsibility of-the-speaker</span> - a simple possessive phrase becomes a full statement.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As you go through this website you will notice other ways in which tvo-Pravic is designed for a different way of life and a different way of thinking.
                </p>
